# Introduction

Today I was learning about preventing object mutation in this case as aseen in the previous challenge const declaraion alone doesnt really protect yoyr data from mutation.
# Body

To ensure yoyr data doesnt change,javascritpt provides a function object freeze to orevent data mutation.using arrow funtion to write conscise anonymous funtion in ths case we learn that,we also ttalk aboutt writing arrow functions here you can pass argument into a arrow funtion eg.const doubler = (item) => item * 2;
doubler(4);


# Cnclusion

I also went through setting default parameters for my functions,
Nevertheless i was doing my to do list trying to solve some challenges i faced on the list i was creating in oder to give it functionality.
